# AI Tooling

## Tools Used
- **GitHub Copilot**: Used for code generation, refactoring, and boilerplate creation.
- **ChatGPT (GPT-4.1)**: Used for design advice, debugging, and documentation generation.

## What Worked Well
- Copilot and ChatGPT accelerated code writing and helped with best practices.
- Automated generation of test cases and CI/CD configuration was efficient.
- AI tools provided quick solutions for common errors and integration issues.

## What Didn’t Work Well
- Some generated code required manual adjustment for project-specific logic.
- Occasional hallucinations or incorrect suggestions needed review.
- Documentation and comments sometimes needed clarification.

## Summary
AI tools were valuable for rapid prototyping, code quality, and automation, but human oversight was essential for correctness and project alignment.
